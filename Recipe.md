* First break the egg in a bowl, add sugar and whisk well.
* Add milk and mix until, it is completly mixed properly with egg and sugar.
* Take a seive and seive the flour and the baking powder in the mixture and slowly mix, until the mixture is completly smooth and there are no lumps of the flour.
* Add the vegetable oil after mixing all other ingridients and mix well and fast until you see little bubbles rising up.
* You can also add vanilla essence or any essecne if you don't want the smell of eggs.

Note: Leave the batter for sometime to make the pancakes fluffy(avg. 15 mins)


Syrup:-
* Making the syrup is super easy...just take one block of a chocoloate like 8-10 cubes of a dairy milk or the chocolate you prefer.
* Add 2 tbsp. of milk to it, and microwave it for 20-30 secs.
* We add the milk because the milk helps the chocolate melt faster and better without burning and makes the mixture smooth like a syrup.


Cooking :-

* Take a big serving spoon which we use for vegetables and a pan.
* Grease the pan with butter and keep the flames on Medium.
* Add the batter to the pan and heat it until you see bubbles forming on the pancake and bursting up from the middle 
* finally turn the pancake and cook it from the other side too.
NOTE: do not let the pan get heated up a lot as it will not cook the pancake from the inside propoerly but burn one side of our pancake.

Serving:-
Finally, serve the pancakes hot/cold as you like and add the syrup on top !
